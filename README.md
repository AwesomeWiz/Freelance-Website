**Freelance Website**   

**Woodco-sa** is a fully responsive business website for a Kerala Gulf diaspora to promote their Industrial Supply Business. Users could view the About page and the range of products the company offers, download their brochures, and a contact form to contact them directly through email.
I fully developed the website(front-end and back-end). Used PHP to implement the contact form used in the website.
Completed in 1 month. Had the great opportunity to improve my coding skills and learned a lot about website hosting and website responsiveness.
